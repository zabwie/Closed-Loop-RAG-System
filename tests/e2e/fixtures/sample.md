# Sample Document

This is a sample Markdown document for testing the RAG pipeline.

## Introduction

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system combines retrieval and generation to provide accurate answers based on retrieved documents.

## Key Components

1. **Document Ingestion**: Converts various file formats into text chunks
2. **Vector Store**: Stores embeddings for similarity search
3. **Retrieval**: Finds relevant documents based on query embeddings
4. **Generation**: Uses LLM to generate answers from retrieved context

## Testing

This document is used for end-to-end testing of the RAG pipeline, including:
- Document ingestion
- Query processing
- Answer generation
- Evaluation metrics

## Conclusion

The RAG system provides a powerful way to combine retrieval and generation for accurate, context-aware responses.
